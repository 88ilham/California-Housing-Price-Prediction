# [WIP] 🏠 California Housing Price Prediction

*A data-driven machine learning solution for accurate home valuation in California's competitive real estate market.*

## 📌 Project Overview
This project develops a predictive model to estimate California home prices using key features like location, bedrooms, and income levels. With **83.2% explanatory power (R²)** and **±17.8% error (MAPE)**, it helps sellers and agents optimize pricing strategies.

Here's a concise yet clear way to communicate the model's accuracy and error metrics in your GitHub README, using both technical and business-friendly language:

### **📈 Model Performance**

#### **Accuracy Metrics**
| Metric       | Value        | What It Means                                                                 |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **R²**       | 0.832        | The model explains **83.2%** of price variability in the California housing market. |
| **MAE**      | $31,445      | On average, predictions are **±$31,445** from actual home prices.             |
| **RMSE**     | $47,325      | Worst-case errors (accounting for outliers) reach **±$47,325**.               |
| **MAPE**     | 17.8%        | Predictions typically fall within **±17.8%** of the true price.               |

#### **Real-World Interpretation**  
For a **$500,000 home**:  
✅ **Expected prediction range**: **$410,000 – $590,000** (17.8% variance)  
⚠️ **High-confidence range**: **$452,675 – $547,325** (RMSE-adjusted)  

---

### **Why These Metrics Matter**
- **R² > 0.8**: Strong correlation between features and prices.  
- **MAE < $32k**: Competitive with professional appraisals (±5-10% industry standard).  
- **MAPE < 20%**: Reliable for pricing guidance in volatile markets.  

---

### **How to Use These Results**
1. **For Sellers**:  
   - Treat model outputs as a **baseline price**.  
   - Adjust ±15% based on curb appeal, market trends, or urgency.  

2. **For Agents**:  
   - Combine with comps for client presentations.  
   - Flag listings where model predictions deviate >20% from asking prices.

### **Limitations**
- Less accurate for:  
  - Luxury homes (>$2M)  
  - Unique properties (e.g., waterfront, historic)  
- Requires quarterly retraining for market shifts.

## 🛠️ Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/california-housing-prediction.git
cd california-housing-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 📂 Dataset
Uses the **California Housing Dataset** (`california_housing.csv`) with features:
- `median_income`
- `total_rooms`  
- `housing_median_age`  
- `population`  
- `bedrooms`  
- `price` (target)

## 🚀 Usage
Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

**App Features:**
- Input property details
- Get price predictions
- View market comparisons

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add luxury home support (>$2M)
